# Backend Information

This repository contains the latest apt-list.txt and pip-freeze.txt files.

## Note:

Be aware that these files do not necessarily reflect the current state of the
production environment, but rather the state as of the most recent submitted
changes. There may be a one or two day delay to see the changes in Colab
runtimes.

## Contributing

If you have a problem, or see something that could be improved, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues). However, we
don't have the bandwidth to support review of external contributions, and we
don't want user PRs to languish, so we aren't accepting any external
contributions right now.
